## Getting Started

On the left side of the page you will find the navigation bar with all the documentation pages currently online. The pages are sorted by Akel modules (such as its core, its platform module, its math module, ...  )

On the right side (or on the top for phone users) of the page you will find the current content of the page and can easily navigate through it.

## Updates

Akel's documentation undergoes regular updates as new things come into Akel. SpinWaves tries to keep the documentation as up to date as possible, but it's a bit of a hassle to keep up with it all at the moment. So please forgive us if the documentation does not get updated right after new Akel features are released.

If you wish, you are free to participate in the development of this documentation, or even of Akel if you feel like it.
